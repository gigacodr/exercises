      <p>
        Amy Chua is a Yale Law professor and the best-selling author of 
        <em>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em>. Her work centers on the 
        intersection of culture, law, and success. She has been a vocal 
        commentator on issues of parenting, education, and global 
        competitiveness, sparking both acclaim and debate across the 
        nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chua's talk will explore the cultural forces that shape family 
        values, academic success, and leadership, while encouraging an 
        open dialogue about achievement and personal growth.
